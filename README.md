Hola. I'm Dave. I work in cyber security, with a focus on security engineering and automation. I'm an aspiring engineer and developer, and am trying to go back to my roots after having spent a large amount of the last 10 years of my career in senior leadership (architecture, consultancy, stuff like that).

I currently work for @AWS in their Professional Services department, and I look after security for AWS's global strategic accounts.

My repos are mainly for things like my dotfiles, setups scripts for my D&D server (Foundry VTT), etc.

You can find me [here](https://www.linkedin.com/in/daveprowse/).
